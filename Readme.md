#### *Instructions on how to use Git:*
1. Install Git on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command line and go to the project directory.
3. Initialize the Git repository inside the project using the **`git init`**.
4. Create a new development branch using the **`git branch "branch name".`**
5. Switch to the created development branch using the **`git checkout  "branch name".`**
6. Create a new file or modify an existing file in the project.
7. Use the **`git add "file name"`** or git add . command to add changes to the index.
8. Use the **`git commit -m "describe changes"`** command to save the changes to the repository.
9. Submit changes to a remote repository using the **`git push origin "branch name".`**
10. You can merge changes to another branch if needed with the **`git merge "branch name".`**
11. If you're having problems along the way, use **`git status`** and **`git log`** to display the repository's status and commit history.
12. Remember to make regular backups of your repository, especially before you make a major change or before you merge branches.
